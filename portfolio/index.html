  <h1>Current and Past Projects</h1>
  <p>Below you'll find the github repositories for, as well as links to my currently running projects.</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/julia-spriggs/kitten-mittens-game">Github Repository for Kitten Mittens Game</a> 
    | <a href="https://julia-spriggs.github.io/kitten-mittens-game/">Kitten Mittens Game</a><br />
    <p>This project is called the Kitten Mittens Game. It was the very first project I made, using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.
      The goal of the game is to get the mittens on the kitten, who moves around in random directions back and forth on the bottom
      of the board. Every time, you successfully put the mittens on the kitten, the kitten moves faster. I created this by myself
      within 5 days.</p>
    <a href="https://github.com/Cocktail-recipes/cocktail-recipes">Github Repository for Cocktail Recipes</a> 
    | <a href="https://cocktail-recipes.adaptable.app">Cocktail recipes</a><br />
    <p>The second project I made was a cocktails recipe website where people can consult, create, edit, and delete cocktail recipes.
      This project was made using MongoDB, Express, Node, Handlebars, and Bootstrap. I worked on this with a classmate, and we created
      the entire web application within 5 days.

    | <a href="https://github.com/project3-ironhack/furever-friends-server">Github Repository for Back-end of Furever Friends</a> 
    | <a href="https://fureverfriends.netlify.app/">Furever Friends</a>
    <p>This final project was a website to help people find cats and dogs that are available for adoption. When you sign up,
      you can do so as either an adopter or an association. The goal being that only associations would be able to create new dogs or cats
    that are avaible for adoption with them. This project was made using the entire MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node). I worked
  on this with a classmate, and we created the entire web application within a week and a half.</p>
