        <h1>First and foremost, I'm a geek and a dork. Sometimes both at once.</h1>
        <p>Some facts about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I'm bilingual in English and French (C2), but sometimes it's too much for my brain. I forget words in English, or mix languages up.</li>
            <li>I married my best friend over 10 years ago. (He's French). We have 2 super senior rescue cats that I adopted in the US and brought to France with me.</li>
            <li>I'm a career changer. I've studied economics, foreign language education, I've worked at a pharmaceutical company doing international logistics. I have a lot of strange work experiences.</li>
            <li>I created my first website when I was a teenager in the 90s using Geocities and pure HTML. (it was a website to showcase my terrible angsty teenage poetry).</li>
            <li>I'm an IRC and debian nerd. I spend way too much time on both, to the point that I now help moderate an IRC network in my freetime.</li>
            <li>I got my citizenship just before my 10 year anniversary of moving to France! Now I can truly and vociferously complain about everything, it's my right! :)</li>
        </ul>
