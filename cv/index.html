				<p>As a former French teacher in the United States, and English teacher in France, I have a passion for lifelong learning and developing new skills that can be used in my professional and personal life.<br />
Former colleagues and friends often say that I'm dedicated and incredibly tenacious. I don't like to let things half-done - I always want to see things through to the end.<br />
I've recently finished a bootcamp learning about the MERN stack, and am eager to put my new knowledge into use and learn ever more.<br /></p>
